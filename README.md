py_coloc_utils
==============

Set of Python/NumPy tools for working with confocal images and
computing colocalization coefficients.

TODO List
=========
Big items:


 * there is a lot of code that can be removed from
   DefinitionsAndUtils.py, GraphAndHistogramUtilities.py, and
   ImageProcessing.py. Much of that code is old and crufty athis
   point.
 
 * It would probably be helpful to have some simplified input data
   (short of the full image set) to demonstrate the use of the main
   functions.

 * Test cases and documentation.
